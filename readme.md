# MachineHack: Cats and Dogs Classifier
***
### Problem Statement
In this hackathon, you will be provided with images of cats and dogs and you must use  your Computer Vision skills to build an image classifier to classify an image as that of a dog or of a cat. In this supervised image classification task, your goal is to classify the images into their respective classes using accuracy as a metric. The Dogs vs Cats is a classic dataset and has been used to train and evaluate models for binary classification tasks. 

### Data Description
* **Train (Folder)**: contains 9471 images of cats and dogs
* **Test (Folder)**: contains 4059 images of cats and dogs
* **Sample_Submission.csv** : The format of submission accepted
* **Train.csv** : contains the file name and appropriate category for each image in the train data.
* **Test.csv** : contains the file name for each image in the test data

### Evaluation Metric
The submission will be evaluated using accuracy metric

### Result
#### No. of registered: 258
